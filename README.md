# System-SWE

To implement this system in Java, you can break it down into several components:

User Registration and Subscription Management:

1. Users provide website URL and notification preferences.
  Store user subscriptions in a database.

2. Website Monitoring:
Periodically check the subscribed websites for updates.
  Use a scheduler for periodic checks.

3. Notification System:
  Generate and deliver notifications via preferred communication channels (e.g., email, SMS).

4. User Management:

Allow users to modify or cancel subscriptions.
Here is a simplified implementation of such a system in Java:

Project Structure
1.Main class to start the application.
2.User class to represent user data.
3.Subscription class to represent a website subscription.
4.SubscriptionManager class to handle subscription management.
5.WebsiteMonitor class to periodically check for updates.
6.NotificationService class to send notifications.
7.Database class to mock database interactions.
